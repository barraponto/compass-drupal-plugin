GUIDELINES FOR NEW THEMES
=========================

A theme in Compass Drupal Plugin is composed of a layout file which will map the theme selectors to the general selectors in project in project/_skin.scss, following a few guidelines:

- No complex selector should have more than one #id simple selector;
- No complex selector should have more than 3 simple selector parts;
- The selectors order should make sense to the theme templates;
